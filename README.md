# Installation
Add a `secret.py` file with the password hash (get it from Nathan) if you want to run it locally.

The `tribes.sh` script is setup for the an nginx hosting with the site added as a service to systemd. I'm also using a virtualenv in my home directory. None of these are really required for running it locally.

Use python 2.7
